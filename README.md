This code represents the implementation of a simple iOS app called "Dicee." The app simulates rolling two dice by changing their images randomly. The app is developed using Swift and targets iOS 13 or later.

Let's break down the code and its components:

1. Import Statements:
   The code begins with an import statement for UIKit, which is the framework that provides the fundamental components and functionality for building iOS apps using Swift.

2. Class Definition:
   The main view controller class is defined as `ViewController`, which inherits from `UIViewController`. This means that `ViewController` is responsible for managing the main view of the app.

3. Outlets:
   The code defines two `UIImageView` outlets:
   - `diceImageView1`: Represents the first dice image view.
   - `diceImageView2`: Represents the second dice image view.

   These outlets are connected to the respective image views in the app's Interface Builder (storyboard) file. They allow the code to update the images displayed on the dice.

4. Dice Images Array:
   The code declares an array called `diceArray`, which contains the names of six dice images. The names correspond to the image files stored in the app's asset catalog. The names are "DiceOne," "DiceTwo," "DiceThree," "DiceFour," "DiceFive," and "DiceSix."

5. `viewDidLoad()` Method:
   This method is part of the UIViewController lifecycle and gets called when the view of the app loads. In this method, the code sets the initial images of the two dice to random values by using the `Int.random(in:)` method to pick a random index from `diceArray` and then setting the image of each `diceImageView` accordingly.

6. `ROLL()` Method:
   This method is triggered when the "ROLL" button is pressed in the app's user interface. When the button is pressed, the code again randomly selects an index from `diceArray` and sets the image of each `diceImageView` accordingly. This effectively simulates rolling the two dice and changing their values.

Overall, the app is simple and allows users to roll two dice and see their values change randomly upon pressing the "ROLL" button. The random number generation is based on the `Int.random(in:)` method, which generates integers within a given range. The app's UI is designed using Interface Builder, and the code connects the UI elements to the view controller using outlets and actions.
